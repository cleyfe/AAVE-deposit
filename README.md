# AAVE-deposit
Use case of the deposit function in AAVE protocol

The project uses Moralis backend to build a simple UI allowing to:
1) Login or logout with your Metamask wallet
2) Get the balance of your tokens on a selection of blockchains
3) Deposit DAI into AAVE protocol (to be available)

Only pre-requisite is to create an account and open a server on Moralis. Then to indicate your server URL and appid at the top of the js file to connect to your server.
