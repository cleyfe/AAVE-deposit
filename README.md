# AAVE-deposit
Use case of the deposit function in AAVE protocol

The project uses Moralis backend to build a simple UI allowing to:
Login or logout with your Metamask wallet
Get the balance of your tokens on a selection of blockchains
Deposit DAI into AAVE protocol (to be available)

Only pre-requisite is to create an account and open a server on Moralis. Then to indicate your server URL and appid at the top of the js file to connect to your server.
